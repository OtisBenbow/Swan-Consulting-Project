# Predictive Modelling - Swan Consulting Project
### Using discrete models in python to predict customer churn risk.
In this project, we were asked to use data from the customer retention team at Swan Consulting to produce 4 Deliverables aimed at understanding customer churn. <br>
These deliverables included: <br>
- An information presentation deck to be used by the team to inform them on the state of play of retentions. This included analysing the demographics of previously churned customers as well as the products they had paid, what factors make a customer more likely to stay or churn, identifying a sign-up service that should be incentivised to reduce the chance of customer churn, and lastly, explaining how we created the models able to predict the liklihood of a customer churning.
- A Python notebook that includes all the relevant exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, train-test splitting, modelling and model evaluation in order to predict customer churn risk.
- A list of the top 500 most likely to churn customers.
- A list of the churn risk of all remaining customers in the dataset.
The data contained several columns of discrete data (eg. Gender: Male/Female, Dependents: Yes/No, Internet Service: Fiber Optic/DSL/No, etc.) allowing for the creation of logistic regressions, decision trees, random forests, and yggdrasil decision forests which were exploring in python.
